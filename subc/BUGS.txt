\f0\fs24 \cf0 NOTES/BUGS:\
\
WORKING - Scanner and parser work 100% accurately for all 25 tiny programs. Tree building/printing works perfectly for 16 out of 25 tiny programs. For the 9 that do not print, most of the tree is still accurate.\
\
BUGS - For programs 3, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 24 there\'92s a problem with the caseClauses() function. The nodes connected with this function are printing in the wrong sequence in the tree and are printing in duplicates in some cases.\
\
NOTES - To change to a different file I\'92ve been changing the string at the top called \'93file\'94.  If you want to test the scanner and parser features, it\'92s easy to do if you uncomment the cout lines on 467 and 468 and just run Tiny() in main, or you can look at the parserOutput files I\'92ve included. These files show the output for every tiny program when lines 467 and 468 are uncommented.  I\'92ve also included a screenshot of this area of code so you can see that it\'92s the parser creating this output. The last screenshot I\'92ve included is me running diff in the terminal on the 16 files that print perfectly.}
